# DNA_Sequence_Detector
DNA_Sequence_Detector is a program to detect a known sequence unit and to count the number of the known sequence unit(s) in a Nanopore long read. Even if the accuracy of the reads is not high, the program can still detect the known sequences. The program can count known sequence units that exist as tandem repeats or interspaced repeats. The program outputs the number of known sequences as a text file in the form of a table, which can be easily handled by a spreadsheet application such as Microsoft Excel. The program also outputs an image showing the locations where known sequences are likely to be located. The program can be changed to the reverse complement mode, and known sequences can be searched in both directions.
